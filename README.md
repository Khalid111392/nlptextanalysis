Sentiment Analysis on Financial Data ðŸ“ˆSentiment Analysis on Financial Data ðŸ“ˆ
In an era where data drives decisions, the fusion of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) emerges as a groundbreaking paradigm. This work delved into the fascinating realm of NLP to bridge the gap between machines and human language, with a focus on the finance domain.

Aim and Objectives:
The primary goal of this project was to construct an effective machine learning model for text analysis using a finance dataset as a case study. Our objectives included researching NLP, understanding NLP techniques, data extraction from Kaggle, building models using NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and K-Neighbours Classification, and evaluating model performance through cross-validation.

Data Extraction and Exploration:
We began by acquiring a comprehensive financial sentiment dataset from Kaggle. This structured dataset contained 5,843 documents, categorized into three sentiments: positive, negative, and neutral. Our data exploration journey involved inspecting data statistics, handling null values, and visualizing sentiment distribution.

Text Preprocessing:
To prepare our text data for analysis, we embarked on a journey of cleaning and transformation. We removed stop words, punctuation, and unnecessary columns. Furthermore, we converted sentences into numerical vectors, enabling machine learning algorithms to decipher language effectively.

Model Selection:
We compared the performance of three popular machine learning algorithms: NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). These models were selected based on their suitability for multi-class classification tasks and their proven efficacy in text analysis.

Presentation of Output and Model Evaluation:
We conducted an evaluation of our models using techniques such as train-test splitting, k-fold cross-validation, and parameter tuning. The performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, provided insights into the effectiveness of each model.
